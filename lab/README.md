# AI Assisted Programming - Algorithms Lab

This lab contains all the code and documentation for AI-assisted programming tasks, including basic functions, calculator, sorting/search algorithms, and data structures.

## Getting Started
- All code is in `algorithms.py` in this folder.
- Run and test the file with:
  ```bash
  python3 algorithms.py
  ```
- Review the code for examples of AI-assisted programming patterns.

## Contents
- Basic greeting and statistics functions
- Calculator class with error handling
- Sorting and search algorithms
- Simple data structure example
- Benchmarking utility

## Submission
- Complete any required tasks in `algorithms.py`
- Commit and push your changes as instructed
