# AI Assisted Programming Examples

This directory contains example code that demonstrates effective AI-assisted programming techniques.

## Files

### `ai_programming_example.py`
A comprehensive example showing:
- AI-assisted class design and implementation
- Use of type hints and dataclasses
- Proper documentation and error handling
- Common design patterns for AI-generated code

## How to Use These Examples

1. **Study the Code Structure**: Notice how the code is organized with clear classes, methods, and documentation
2. **Practice with AI Tools**: Use GitHub Copilot to extend or modify these examples
3. **Learn Patterns**: Identify common patterns that work well with AI assistance
4. **Experiment**: Try asking AI to add new features or refactor existing code

## AI Programming Best Practices Demonstrated

- **Clear Intent**: Functions and classes have descriptive names
- **Type Hints**: Proper type annotations help AI understand context
- **Documentation**: Docstrings provide context for AI suggestions
- **Modular Design**: Code is broken into logical, reusable components
- **Error Handling**: Appropriate exception handling and validation

## Exercises

Try using AI assistance to:
1. Add new methods to the TaskManager class
2. Implement data validation
3. Add unit tests for the existing code
4. Create a web API wrapper for the TaskManager
5. Add database persistence functionality

## Tips for AI-Assisted Programming

- Write descriptive comments to guide AI suggestions
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Structure your code logically before asking for AI help
- Test AI-generated code thoroughly
- Don't hesitate to refactor AI suggestions to fit your style
